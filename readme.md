[![Crate Version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/terminal-colorsaurus)](https://crates.io/crates/terminal-colorsaurus)

A cross-platform library for determining the terminal's background and foreground color. \
It answers the question *Â«Is this terminal dark or light?Â»*.

Works in all major terminals including Windows Terminal (starting with v1.22).

## Example
```rust,no_run
use terminal_colorsaurus::{theme_mode, QueryOptions, ThemeMode};

match theme_mode(QueryOptions::default()).unwrap() {
    ThemeMode::Dark => { /* ... */ },
    ThemeMode::Light => { /* ... */ },
}
```

## MSRV Policy

This crate's Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is based
on the MSRVs of downstream users such as [`delta`] and [`bat`].
Changes to the MSRV will be accompanied by a minor version bump.

The following formula determines the MSRV:
```text
min(msrv(bat), msrv(delta))
```

## Inspiration
This crate borrows ideas from many other projects. This list is by no means exhaustive.

* [xterm-query]: Use `mio` to wait for the terminal's response with a timeout.
* [termbg]: Lists a lot of terminals which served as a good starting point for me to test terminals as well.
* [macOS doesn't like polling /dev/tty][macos-dev-tty] by Nathan Craddock
* [This excellent answer on Stack Overflow][perceived-lightness] for determining the perceived lightness of a color.
* [This comment in the Terminal WG](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/terminal-wg/specifications/-/issues/8#note_151381) for the `DA1` trick
  to easily detect terminals that don't support querying the colors with `OSC 10` / `OSC 11`.
